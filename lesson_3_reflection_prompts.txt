When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repository will be useful when many people are working on the same 
    files at the same time. it is also useful when one work at different location
    on the same file i.e (home and work)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When working on a file, each commit ought to represent a logical process, 
    one might need to complete many logical process in
    order to complete a feature. Having git automatically synchronizing each
    commit might introduce a bug into the program. Another scenerio is when
    one is testing a feature locally, automatic syncing will make such feature
    available to others working on the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are project that are available alone for cloning and not modification
    project obtained through forks can be modified and updated locally but can 
    not be updated at the source. a person working on forks can only suggest
    improvement to forks projects authors and taking such suggestion is at
    their discretion. 
    Clones is the process of copying a project along with the history of 
    commits and branches. Fork project are often cloned in other to create a  
    personalised copy which can be easily update and modified personally.
    Branches are created from the master or another branch in order to 
    experiment on certain feature one might not be totally convinced yet
    that it should be on main project. 
    Forks are exclusive to GitHub while clone can be done on local machine as
    well as github.
